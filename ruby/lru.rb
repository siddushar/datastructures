# The hash tableâ€™s keys consist of the keys for our cache and values are actually nodes within the doubly linked list.
# We always keep track of the head and tail of this list. When we want to get a value out this cache, we look for that 
# key in the hash table and return the associated node from the doubly linked list. In addition, we move that node from 
# wherever it is in the list to the very back of the list. This makes sure that the least recently used item is always 
# at the very front of the list. So, when we want to insert a new item into our cache and the cache is full, we simply 
# pop off an item from the front of the list.
